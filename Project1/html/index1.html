     <!--General Interests Section-->
     <div id="generalInterests">
       <h3>General Interests</h3>
       <ol>
         <li><strong>Tech:</strong> I enjoy learning about all the latest technology. I find it fascinating how things continue to evolve and am excited for future advancements. I feel like I could talk for hours about certain things.</li>
         <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Exploring and discovering new places and foods is always fun. Over the summer I went to Boston, Maine and Canada. It's crazy to see all the diversity in terms of things like food and landscapes/tourist attractions.</li>
         <li><strong>Coding:</strong> I am working on polishing up my C++ skills thoroughn working on a visual Turing Machine Editor. Last semester in one of my classes we worked with Turing Machines and it was interesting how even the most complex of mathematical/computer science problems could be solved with a machine that has such basic instructions.
           It is hard to visualize and see how they work, so I thought creating a visual representation could be useful in itself and could bolster my resume.</li>
         <li><strong>Cars:</strong> I've recently had a spike in interest for Japanese and European cars and their car scenes. I like seeing creations come to life and having the ability to customize something so much to appeal to every sense and make it different from the base that it was created from.</li>
         <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> In my spare time I like to play video games with friends. Among my favorites are Valorant, Call of Duty, Rocket League and TeamFight Tactics.</li>
       </ol>

     <!--Favorite Song, Film and TV Show Section-->
     <div id="favorites">
       <h3>Favorite Song, Film and TV Show</h3>

       <h4>Favorite Song</h4>
         <p>I listen to music from all types of genres and I don't have a favorite song of all time, but at this moment the one I'm listening to on repeat is <span style="background-color:powderblue">Live In Myth</span>
           by Brock Wilson. I find it to just be a very chill song that I have on in the background when doing schoolwork or playing games.</p>
         <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_YeAD8e_Gc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

       <h4>Favorite Film</h4>
         <p><span style="background-color:peachpuff">Ford vs Ferrari</span> takes place in the early 60s and follows the story of how Carrol Shelby and Ken Miles helped build a racecar to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans . In this scene, Carrol Shelby recently agreed to help Ford create a racecar
            that could beat Ferrari and he invites Ken to test drive for him. It is one of my favorites because it shows the fun yet business oriented relationship between the two and Ken's fixation of creating the best racecar in the world. I also love Matt Damon and Christian Bale who played Shelby and Miles respectively.</p>

       <h4>Favorite TV Show</h4>
         <p><span style="background-color:orchid">The Boys</span> is a highly unique, modern and realistic take on superheroes and their roles in society. It's one of my favorite shows because of the unpredictability and plot twists that it offers around every corner.
            This scene is from the beginning of the first season and shows how Hughie takes a leap from electronic store clerk to anti-superhero fighter by joining forces with Butcher, the main anti-super character. Note: This scene has a lot of cursing. There are
            a lot of other good scenes, but most of them are much more violent and graphic.</p>

     <!--Favorite Website-->
     <div id="favoriteWebsite">
     <h3>Favorite Website</h3>
       <p>I find that I'm not that artistic of a person, at least I have good ideas, but when it comes to execution, ie drawing/painting, I'm a mess. That's why I find websites
         that help that creativity come to life are really fun to mess around with. My two favorite websites are:</p>
       <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground" target="_blank"> OpenAI </a>
             <p> This website allows you to write in a bunch of initial instrunctions and the AI will do it's best to finish it, however an account is required for use. A lot of the time the results
               are very entertaining. Here's a good/funny one that one of my friends made.</p>

           </li>
           <li> <a href="https://app.wombo.art" target="_blank"> Wombo </a>
             <p> This website also uses AI, but to create images from words/phrases in many different styles including watercolor, physcic, steampunk and my personal favorite synthwave. It isn't super HD, but the results can be quite incredible. 
                Here's one that I created, which represent a futuristic glass city.</p>
